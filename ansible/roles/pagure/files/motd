Welcome to the Pagure development environment!

Here are some tips:


* The code for Pagure is located at ~/devel/
* You can populate the database with `python dev-data.py --all`
* Logs for the server are available with `journalctl`; the services are run
  as systemd user units in ~/.config/systemd/user/

* To run the tests run: `tox -c ~/devel/tox.ini`.

Here is a list of command and alias you may find useful:

* pstart: to start all the services
* pstop:  to stop all the services
* prestart: to restart all the services
* plog:   to access the logs of the `pagure` service (the web server)


Once you start the server you can navigate to http://localhost:5000/
in your browser on the host to access your Pagure development environment.

During your navigate you can use any of the created users,
by example `pingou/testing123`.

Happy hacking!
